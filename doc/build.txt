File owl_cpp/doc/build.txt
provides instructions for building owl_cpp library and for running tests

Libraries required by owl_cpp are listed in file "user-config.jam.txt".
Build is managed by Boost.Build V2 (http://www.boost.org/boost-build2).

1. Download current distribution of Boost (http://www.boost.org/).
   Expand the archive on your hard drive.

2. Build Boost.Jam by running $(BOOST)/tools/build/v2/bootstrap.(bat or sh) script,
   where $(BOOST) is the path to the Boost root directory, 
   e.g., "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_46_1".
   See also http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html

3. If not already present, copy "doc/boost-build.jam" to owl_cpp/ 
   or to any directory above it.  Adjust the path to Boost.Build.
   For details see "doc/boost-build.jam" file.

4. If not already present, copy file "doc/user-config.jam" to your HOME folder.
   Edit it to specify compilers and locations of required libraries. 
   For details see "doc/user-config.jam" file.

5. (optional) In Eclipse/CDT create build variable ${bjam_path} 
	pointing to BOOST.Jam executable.  For example:
        bjam_path=$(BOOST)/tools/build/v2/bjam.exe

6. Run BOOST.Jam in folder owl_cpp.  Examples:
        $(bjam_path) release lib_owl_cpp
        $(bjam_path) -j8 debug test
        $(bjam_path) --toolset=msvc release lib_owl_cpp
        $(bjam_path) autodoc
   where $(bjam_path) is path to Boost.Jam executable.
