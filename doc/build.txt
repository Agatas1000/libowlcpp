File owl_cpp/doc/build.txt
provides instructions for building owl_cpp library and for running tests

owl_cpp is built using Boost.Build V2 (http://www.boost.org/boost-build2).
Libraries required by owl_cpp are listed in file "user-config.jam.txt".

1. Download current distribution of Boost (http://www.boost.org/).
   Expand the archive on your hard drive.

2. Change directory to $(BOOST)/tools/build/v2/, where $(BOOST) is the path 
   to the Boost root directory, e.g., "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_47_0".
   Build Boost.Build by running bootstrap.(bat or sh) script.
   See also http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html

3. (optional) Add location of Boost.Build executable to your PATH variable,
   e.g., "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_47_0\tools\build\v2"

4. If not already present, copy "doc/boost-build.jam" to owl_cpp/ 
   or to any directory above it.  Adjust the path to Boost.Build.
   For details see "doc/boost-build.jam" file.

5. If not already present, copy file "doc/user-config.jam" to your HOME folder.
   Edit it to specify compilers and the libraries used by owl_cpp. 
   For details see "doc/user-config.jam" file.

6. Run Boost.Build in folder owl_cpp.  Examples:
        b2 release
        b2 debug test
        b2 --toolset=msvc release
        b2 autodoc
